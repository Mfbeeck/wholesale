		<li id = "description">
			It’s an e-commerce site where you participate in lotteries to win items you like by paying a ticket worth a
			fraction of the item's retail price. The number of participants allowed in is capped, so the odds are great.</li>
		<br/>
		<li id = "description-title">How It Works</li>
		<li id = "description">
			<p>1. Find a product you like.</p>
			<p>2. Buy a lottery ticket so you get a chance to win that product. ParlayVous will reward you with one point for every purchase.</p>
			<p>3. Wait for other players to buy tickets and compete for the same product.</p>
			<p>4. As soon as the required number of lottery participants is reached the lottery takes place.</p>
			<p>5. Finally: you win! …or try again with another product.</p>
